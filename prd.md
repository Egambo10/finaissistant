### PRD: FinAIssistant — AI Expense Tracker (Telegram)

- **Owner**: You
- **Product**: FinAIssistant (Telegram bot)
- **Primary goal**: Log expenses conversationally and answer finance questions from a Supabase-backed database.
- **Target users**: Individual user(s) using Telegram daily.

## 1) Problem & Objectives
- **Problem**: Manual expense logging is tedious; reporting across categories and budgets is fragmented.
- **Objectives**
  - Capture expenses via natural text in Telegram (“Costco 120.54”).
  - Auto-classify each expense to an existing `categories` row; ask for confirmation when unsure.
  - Maintain daily reminders to submit expenses.
  - Answer natural questions about spend and budgets with accurate SQL-backed answers.
  - Provide concise daily/weekly/monthly summaries on request.

## 2) Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 7-day retention > 60%.
- **Data completeness**: ≥ 80% of days have at least one interaction or explicit “no expenses today”.
- **Classification accuracy**: ≥ 90% auto-classified without correction; ≥ 98% after one follow-up.
- **Question accuracy**: ≥ 95% of answers match SQL truth for curated test queries.
- **Reminder compliance**: ≥ 80% of reminders get a response within 24h.

## 3) Scope

### MVP (v1)
- Telegram bot that:
  - Logs expenses with amount, merchant, date, currency.
  - Auto-categorizes using existing `categories`; fallback: top-3 suggestions → confirm or create new.
  - Daily reminder at user’s chosen local time.
  - Natural-language Q&A for:
    - Today/this week/this month totals.
    - Spend by category.
    - Monthly budget summary.
  - Edit and delete last N expenses.
  - Basic multi-currency support using `currency_rates`.
- Adminless single-user or few users.

### Post-MVP
- Shared expenses (“paid_by” handling), split bills.
- Multi-user household budgets.
- Export to CSV/Google Sheets.
- Merchant normalization and custom rules.
- Advanced insights (trends, anomalies, forecast).

## 4) Key User Stories

- As a user, I can send “Costco 120.54” and it’s saved as an expense in `expenses` with category “Supermarket”.
- If classification uncertainty is high, the bot replies with “Is this Supermarket, Groceries, Household? Or create new?” and saves based on my response.
- I get a daily reminder at 20:00 local time: “Any expenses today?” with quick replies [Yes] [No].
- I can ask: “What were my expenses this week?”, “Compare May vs June by category”, “Which category did I spend most last month?”
- I can ask for “Monthly Budget Summary” and receive a formatted block with Spent/Budget/Remaining/Used% and today’s expenses list.
- I can change reminder time and default currency in settings.
- I can correct: “Edit last expense to 118.20” or “Change category to Restaurants”.

## 5) System Architecture

- **Telegram Bot Server** (Node.js/TypeScript or Python) hosted on your preferred runtime (Fly.io, Render, Supabase Edge Functions).
- **NLU Orchestrator**
  - Intent detection: add_expense, query_summary, query_budget, compare_periods, list_categories, create_category, edit_expense, delete_expense, settings, help.
  - Expense parser: merchant, amount, currency, date, notes.
  - Category classifier: semantic + rules + string similarity.
  - SQL executor: whitelisted query templates with parameters only.
- **Supabase**: persistence, auth, Row Level Security (RLS).
- **Scheduler**: daily reminders (Supabase Scheduled Functions or hosted cron).
- **Observability**: Structured logs + metrics dashboard.

## 6) Data Model (Supabase tables in use)

- `users(id, name, telegram_id, created_at)`
- `categories(id, name, description, created_at)`
- `expenses(id, user_id, category_id, expense_detail, amount, original_amount, original_currency, currency, expense_date, paid_by, notes, timestamp, created_at)`
- `budgets(id, category_id, amount, currency, month, year, created_at)`
- `currency_rates(id, base_currency, target_currency, rate, updated_at)`
- `conversation_state(chat_id, last_status, payload, updated_at)` — for multi-turn flows.
- `n8n_chat_histories(id, session_id, message, ...)` — optional long-term transcript.

Relations:
- `expenses.user_id → users.id`
- `expenses.category_id → categories.id`
- `budgets.category_id → categories.id`

## 7) RLS & Security

- Map Telegram `chat_id`/`user.id` to a `users` row on `/start`.
- RLS (examples):
  - On `expenses`: `user_id = auth.uid()` if using Supabase auth; OR enforce via backend only (service key) and include `user_id` server-side from Telegram identity mapping.
  - On `budgets`: read/write restricted to owner.
- Never accept raw SQL from LLM; use named, parameterized templates.
- PII minimized; store only Telegram `id` and display name.

## 8) AI/NLP Design

- **Parsing**
  - Pattern-first (regex) for fast paths: `<merchant> <amount> [<currency>] [<date>]`.
  - LLM fallback for free-form sentences, extracting merchant, amount, date, currency, notes.
  - Default date: today (user’s timezone).
  - Default currency: user setting; if amount includes currency symbol/code, store original_* and convert to user currency using `currency_rates`.

- **Categorization**
  - Hybrid approach:
    - Rule map for known merchants (e.g., “Costco” → Supermarket).
    - Fuzzy match between merchant/notes and `categories.name` + `description` (cosine similarity on embeddings).
    - LLM tie-breaker with provided category list; require one of the known names.
  - Confidence threshold (e.g., 0.75):
    - ≥ threshold: auto-assign and confirm silently (or with toast message).
    - < threshold: ask user to choose among top-3; provide “Create new category” flow.

- **Intent taxonomy & tooling**
  - record_expense(payload)
  - list_categories()
  - create_category(name, description?)
  - get_totals(range, filters?)
  - get_totals_by_category(range)
  - compare_periods_by_category(periodA, periodB)
  - get_monthly_budget_summary(month, year)
  - edit_expense(expense_id, fields)
  - delete_expense(expense_id)
  - set_reminder_time(timezone, hh:mm)
  - set_budget(category_id, amount, currency, month, year)

- **Conversation patterns**
  - Use `conversation_state` to track pending confirmations (e.g., awaiting category choice, awaiting amount).
  - Short, affirmative confirmations; avoid over-talking.

- **Hallucination mitigations**
  - When asked for categories, fetch from DB and present actual list.
  - When answering quantitative questions, include query time range and currency; provide precise totals.

## 9) Telegram UX

- Commands: `/start`, `/help`, `/summary`, `/today`, `/week`, `/month`, `/budget`, `/categories`, `/settings`.
- Quick replies:
  - After reminder: [Add expense] [No expenses today]
  - For classification: Top-3 categories + “Create new”
- Formatting: concise blocks; currency and dates localized.

Example “Monthly Budget Summary” format:
- Spent: $740.27 CAD
- Budget: $5,040.00 CAD
- Remaining: $4,299.73 CAD
- Used: 14.7%
- Today’s Expenses list
- Total Today

## 10) Core Functional Requirements (MVP)

- **Expense capture**
  - Parse merchant, amount, currency, date, notes.
  - Store `original_amount` and `original_currency`; convert to `currency` (user base).
  - If category unresolved, present suggestions; support create-new.
  - Persist in `expenses` with `timestamp` and `expense_date`.

- **Queries**
  - “Today/This week/This month totals”
  - “By category until today”
  - “Compare May vs June by category”
  - “Top category last month”
  - “Show today’s expenses”

- **Budgets**
  - Set monthly budget per category in `budgets`.
  - Summary for current month; compute “Spent” against expenses.

- **Reminders**
  - One reminder per day at user-configured time and timezone.
  - If unanswered, optional nudge next morning.

- **Edits**
  - Change amount/category/date/notes for last expense or by id.
  - Delete last expense or specific id.

- **Settings**
  - Default currency, timezone, reminder time.

## 11) SQL Templates (parameterized)

- Totals this week:
```sql
select coalesce(sum(e.amount), 0) as total
from expenses e
where e.user_id = :user_id
  and e.expense_date >= date_trunc('week', now() at time zone :tz)::date
  and e.expense_date <= (now() at time zone :tz)::date;
```

- By category month-to-date:
```sql
select c.name as category, sum(e.amount) as total
from expenses e
join categories c on c.id = e.category_id
where e.user_id = :user_id
  and date_trunc('month', e.expense_date) = date_trunc('month', now() at time zone :tz)
group by c.name
order by total desc;
```

- Compare months by category:
```sql
with m as (
  select
    c.name as category,
    date_trunc('month', e.expense_date) as month,
    sum(e.amount) as total
  from expenses e
  join categories c on c.id = e.category_id
  where e.user_id = :user_id
    and date_trunc('month', e.expense_date) in (:m1, :m2)
  group by 1,2
)
select category,
  sum(case when month = :m1 then total else 0 end) as total_m1,
  sum(case when month = :m2 then total else 0 end) as total_m2
from m
group by category
order by (total_m2 - total_m1) desc;
```

- Top category last month:
```sql
select c.name, sum(e.amount) as total
from expenses e
join categories c on c.id = e.category_id
where e.user_id = :user_id
  and date_trunc('month', e.expense_date) = date_trunc('month', (now() at time zone :tz) - interval '1 month')
group by c.name
order by total desc
limit 1;
```

- Budget summary (current month):
```sql
with budget as (
  select b.category_id, b.amount, b.currency
  from budgets b
  where b.month = extract(month from now() at time zone :tz)
    and b.year  = extract(year  from now() at time zone :tz)
),
spent as (
  select e.category_id, sum(e.amount) as spent
  from expenses e
  where e.user_id = :user_id
    and date_trunc('month', e.expense_date) = date_trunc('month', now() at time zone :tz)
  group by e.category_id
)
select c.name,
       coalesce(s.spent, 0) as spent,
       coalesce(b.amount, 0) as budget,
       greatest(coalesce(b.amount,0) - coalesce(s.spent,0), 0) as remaining
from categories c
left join budget b on b.category_id = c.id
left join spent  s on s.category_id = c.id
where b.amount is not null
order by c.name;
```

## 12) Classification Rules & Fallbacks

- Merchant normalization (examples):
  - “Costco”, “COSTCO WHOLESALE” → “Supermarket”
  - “Uber Eats”, “DoorDash” → “Restaurants”
- Fuzzy string similarity for merchant/category names.
- If confidence < threshold:
  - Present top-3 categories (with spend-to-date badges).
  - Offer “Create new category” → insert into `categories`, then continue.

## 13) Multi‑Currency

- Store `original_amount`/`original_currency`.
- Convert using `currency_rates` at insert time to user base currency (`currency`).
- Nightly updater job: refresh `currency_rates` from external API.
- All summaries computed in user base currency; show original in detail view if requested.

## 14) Reminders & Scheduling

- Per-user `timezone` and `reminder_time` stored (settings table or `users` JSONB config).
- Daily cron fetches users due in current minute; sends reminder message.
- Respect quiet hours toggle.

## 15) Error Handling

- Ambiguous parse → ask: “I found merchant=Costco, amount=120.54 CAD, today. Correct?” with Yes/Change.
- Unknown category → suggestions + create-new.
- On DB failure → apology + retry prompt; never lose user’s message (queue unsaved payload in `conversation_state.payload`).

## 16) Non‑Functional Requirements

- **Reliability**: > 99% daily job success rate.
- **Latency**: < 1.5s median response for standard queries; < 4s for LLM parse.
- **Scalability**: Up to a few thousand users on single instance.
- **Privacy**: Data stored only in Supabase; no messages retained by LLM provider beyond processing; redact secrets in logs.

## 17) Testing & Acceptance

- Unit tests:
  - Parser examples: “Costco 120.54”, “Uber Eats $18 yesterday”, “€20 coffee 2024-12-01”.
  - Classifier thresholds and fallbacks.
  - SQL template bindings.
- Integration tests:
  - End-to-end message → DB row.
  - Summary correctness against seeded fixtures.
  - Reminder dispatch and snooze.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - All MVP stories demonstrably working from Telegram.
  - SQL answers match truth tables for 20+ curated questions.

## 18) Implementation Notes

- Tech choice: TypeScript + Telegraf or Python + python-telegram-bot.
- Deploy: Supabase Edge Functions or small Node server + cron (Supabase Scheduler/Cloudflare Cron).
- Config: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, currency API key.
- Observability: request/intent logs, classification confidence, DB query time, message error rate.

## 19) Example Dialogues

- **User**: “Costco 120.54”
  - **Bot**: “Logged $120.54 CAD at Costco → Supermarket. Want to add notes?”
- **User**: “What were my expenses this week?”
  - **Bot**: “Week-to-date: $342.10 CAD. By category: Supermarket $180.10, Restaurants $92.00, Transport $70.00.”
- **User**: “Compare May and June by category”
  - **Bot**: “June vs May (CAD): Supermarket +$120, Restaurants −$45, Transport +$20… Want a chart?”
- **User**: “Monthly budget summary”
  - **Bot**:
    - Spent: $740.27 CAD
    - Budget: $5,040.00 CAD
    - Remaining: $4,299.73 CAD
    - Used: 14.7%
    - Today: Costco $120.54 CAD (Total Today: $120.54)

## 20) Phase Plan

- Week 1: Bot skeleton, `/start`, user mapping, expense insert, regex parser, manual category rules.
- Week 2: LLM parse + classifier with category list, confirmation flows, SQL templates.
- Week 3: Budgets, summaries, reminders with timezone, edits/deletes.
- Week 4: Hardening, RLS, metrics, tests, polish.


## 21) Dynamic NL→SQL (when no template matches)

- **Goal**: Allow “ask anything about expenses/budgets” without being limited to prewritten templates while keeping data safe.

- **Flow**
  1. Classify intent. If no high-confidence template matches, route to NL→SQL sub-agent.
  2. Sub-agent receives: schema (tables/columns, RLS notes), example queries, list of approved views, and guardrails.
  3. Sub-agent produces a structured plan:
     - requested_metrics, dimensions, filters, time_range, currency_behavior, assumptions.
  4. Sub-agent drafts one SELECT-only SQL query (single statement) over approved tables/views.
  5. SQL Critic verifies:
     - read-only, one statement, no DDL/DML; no functions outside whitelist; projected columns exist; valid time filters; bound parameters only.
     - optionally runs `EXPLAIN` to estimate cost.
  6. If passes, execute via read-only pool with statement timeout and row limit. Otherwise, ask user for clarification or fall back to a simpler query.
  7. Post-processing in app code for secondary analytics (percent change, ranks, percentiles).
  8. Sub-agent writes a short “facts” block with totals used in the answer; main agent formats the reply.

- **Guardrails & Limits**
  - Dedicated DB role `finai_readonly` with only SELECT on `expenses`, `categories`, `budgets`, `currency_rates` (respecting RLS). No access to admin/system tables.
  - Connection-level settings: `statement_timeout=5000ms`, `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout=1000ms`, `search_path=public`, `application_name='finai_nl2sql'`.
  - Query limits: max 10k rows returned; enforce `LIMIT` if absent; forbid multi-statements and COPY.
  - Tokenizer: disallow semicolons, comments, `;`, `--`, `/* */`, and `pg_` functions.
  - Heavy or ambiguous requests trigger a confirmation prompt with an estimated cost/time window.

- **RAG-style Query Library**
  - Maintain a library of vetted SQL templates with natural-language descriptions and embeddings.
  - Retrieval step recalls nearest examples; sub-agent adapts them to the user’s parameters.
  - After successful novel queries, auto-suggest saving them to the library for reuse and regression tests.

- **Computation Strategy**
  - Keep SQL minimal and aggregated; compute ratios, deltas, growth rates, rankings in app code to reduce SQL complexity and risk.
  - For comparative questions (e.g., “compare May and June by category”), fetch both periods in one query and compute diffs in code.

- **Correctness & Testing**
  - Golden Q&A set: 50+ questions with expected results validated against fixtures.
  - Shadow mode in prod: log generated SQL and resulting numbers; periodically review and promote stable patterns into first-class templates.

## 22) Operational Setup (Telegram & Webhooks)

- Use BotFather to create the bot, set name, username, and obtain `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
- Set bot commands: `/start`, `/help`, `/summary`, `/today`, `/week`, `/month`, `/budget`, `/categories`, `/settings`.
- Deploy webhook endpoint and register it with Telegram.
- See `TELEGRAM_SETUP.md` for step-by-step instructions and verification commands.

## 23) n8n Interop Strategy

- Keep n8n as an orchestrator if desired, but route free-form questions to a custom webhook (Edge Function or small Node/Python service) that runs the NL→SQL flow described above.
- n8n nodes continue to handle deterministic actions (add expense, send reminder); complex analytics are delegated to the service and results are returned to n8n for messaging.


## 24) Agent Orchestration (LangChain-first)

- **Requirement (updated)**: The assistant must be an AI Agent that is the first responder. It decides which tool to use per message. Use LangChain for tool orchestration.
- **Core tools**
  - `parse_expense` (regex/NLU) → extract merchant, amount, currency, date.
  - `classify_expense` → uses the category dictionary (seeded from `expenses.md`) + rules; confirms when low confidence.
  - `convert_currency` → reads `currency_rates` to convert MXN/USD → CAD.
  - `insert_expense` → writes to `expenses` with today’s date by default.
  - `sql_template_query` → runs parameterized predefined queries.
  - `nl2sql_query` → generates safe SELECT-only SQL (with guardrails) when no template exists.
  - `summarize_budget` → composes template queries to produce the monthly budget block.
- **Conversation behavior**
  - Greetings ("hi/hello…") → short salute + examples.
  - If classification fails → present top-choices + "Create new" option.
  - Any natural-language question → choose template or `nl2sql_query`, respond with concise formatted text.

### LangChain design
- LLM: `gpt-5-mini` (as provided).
- Chain style: Tools Agent (function/tool calling). Inputs: user text; Context vars: `userId`, timezone (America/Vancouver), base currency (CAD).
- Guardrails: SELECT-only analytics, single statement, `LIMIT` enforced, read-only role.
- Fallback: if the agent cannot classify or parse with confidence, ask a targeted follow-up.

### Node vs Python (architecture note)
- We attempted Node.js LangChain agents. Current issues encountered on Node v24 with recent LangChain versions:
  - Import path errors (package subpaths not exported).
  - Peer version conflicts between `@langchain/core` and `@langchain/openai`.
  - Agent executor API mismatch (`_agentActionType is not a function`).
- Options:
  - Pin to a known-good Node stack (e.g., Node 20 LTS, `langchain@0.2.17`, `@langchain/openai@0.3.17`, `@langchain/core@0.3.30`) and use the Tools Agent. Validate with a small POC.
  - Or migrate the agent layer to Python (LangChain + `langchain-openai`) where the agent APIs are more stable, expose a small HTTP endpoint; keep Telegram bot in Node, calling the Python agent for decisions/SQL. This decouples the bot I/O from the reasoning runtime.
