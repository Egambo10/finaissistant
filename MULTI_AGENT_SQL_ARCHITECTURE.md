# Multi-Agent SQL Architecture for AI Database Assistants

This document outlines the architectural approach for building intelligent AI assistants that can interact with SQL databases through natural language queries. The system uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern to balance performance, safety, and flexibility.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The system employs a three-tier agent architecture:

1. **Main Orchestrator Agent** - Routes user intent and manages conversation flow
2. **SQL Library Consultant** - Manages predefined query templates and routing decisions  
3. **Dynamic SQL Writer** - Generates safe SQL for novel queries

This approach provides the benefits of fast template-based queries while maintaining the flexibility to handle any user question through dynamic SQL generation.

## 🎯 Core Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Build an AI assistant that can answer ANY natural language question about a database while maintaining:
- **Performance**: Fast responses for common queries
- **Safety**: No SQL injection or unauthorized access
- **Flexibility**: Handle novel questions without manual template creation
- **Intelligence**: Make smart routing decisions, not hardcoded pattern matching

**Solution**: Multi-agent system where agents "talk to each other" and make intelligent decisions about how to answer each question.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

### 1. Main Orchestrator Agent (GPT-4.1)

**Role**: Primary conversation manager and decision maker

**Responsibilities**:
- Parse user intent (expense entry vs analytical query vs casual conversation)
- Route queries to appropriate SQL handling system
- Format final responses with context and explanations
- Handle conversation flow and error recovery

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Uses most capable model (GPT-4.1) for complex decision making
- Maintains conversation context and user preferences
- Can escalate complex queries or request clarification

```python
# Orchestrator prompt structure
"""You are an AI financial assistant. For each message:
1. Determine if this is an expense entry, analytical query, or conversation
2. For analytical queries, use the SqlQuery tool with appropriate routing
3. For expense entries, use ParseExpense → ClassifyExpense → InsertExpense
4. For conversation, respond naturally and helpfully
"""
```

### 2. SQL Library Consultant Agent

**Role**: Template library manager and intelligent query router

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintain awareness of all available predefined SQL templates
- Analyze incoming questions for template compatibility
- Make intelligent routing decisions (template vs dynamic SQL)
- Return structured routing recommendations

**Intelligence Features**:
- Semantic understanding of query requirements vs template capabilities
- Confidence scoring for template matches
- Ability to identify when templates are insufficient

```python
async def _consult_sql_library(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Consult SQL Library Agent for template matching"""
    consultant_prompt = f"""You are the SQL Library Consultant for a financial database.

    AVAILABLE TEMPLATES:
    - total_spent_period: Total spending for date ranges
    - expenses_by_category: Category breakdowns with totals
    - recent_expenses: Recent transaction lists
    - budget_vs_spending: Budget analysis and percentages
    [... full template list with descriptions ...]

    USER QUESTION: "{question}"

    Analyze if any existing template can fully answer this question.
    
    Respond in JSON: {{"has_template": true/false, "template_name": "name" or null, "confidence": 0.0-1.0}}
    """
    
    # Get routing decision from GPT-4.1
    response = await self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 3. Dynamic SQL Writer Agent

**Role**: Safe SQL generation for novel queries

**Responsibilities**:
- Generate SELECT-only SQL for questions not covered by templates
- Apply comprehensive safety guardrails
- Handle complex natural language to SQL translation
- Clean and format generated SQL

**Safety Features**:
- Only SELECT statements allowed
- SQL injection prevention through pattern detection
- Dangerous keyword blocking (DROP, DELETE, UPDATE, etc.)
- Output sanitization (remove markdown code blocks, semicolons)

```python
async def _generate_sql(self, question: str) -> str:
    """Generate dynamic SQL with safety guardrails"""
    sql_prompt = f"""Generate a PostgreSQL SELECT query for: "{question}"

    DATABASE SCHEMA:
    - expenses: user transactions with amounts, dates, categories
    - categories: expense classification system  
    - users: user information and names
    
    RULES:
    1. SELECT queries only - no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
    2. Use proper JOINs for related data
    3. Include appropriate WHERE clauses for date filtering
    4. Return clean SQL without markdown formatting
    5. No semicolons at the end
    """
    
    response = await self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": sql_prompt}]
    )
    
    # Clean the generated SQL
    raw_sql = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return self._clean_sql(raw_sql)
```

## 🔄 Query Flow Process

### Step 1: Intent Recognition
```
User Input → Main Agent Analysis → Route Decision
```

The main agent determines:
- Is this an expense entry? → Use expense processing tools
- Is this an analytical query? → Route to SQL system  
- Is this casual conversation? → Respond conversationally

### Step 2: SQL Library Consultation
```
Analytical Query → SQL Library Consultant → Template Match Decision
```

The consultant evaluates:
- Does an existing template fully cover this question?
- What's the confidence level of the match?
- Are there any missing parameters or edge cases?

### Step 3: Query Execution Route

**Route A: Template-Based (Fast Path)**
```
High Confidence Template Match → Execute Predefined Query → Format Results
```

**Route B: Dynamic SQL (Flexible Path)**
```
No Template Match → Dynamic SQL Writer → Safety Check → Execute → Format Results
```

### Step 4: Result Processing
```
Raw SQL Results → Context Addition → Natural Language Formatting → User Response
```

## 🛡 Safety & Security Framework

### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Input Sanitization**: Remove dangerous SQL keywords and patterns
- **Template Validation**: All predefined queries use parameterized inputs
- **Dynamic SQL Scanning**: Multiple layers of safety checks before execution

### Database Security
- **Read-Only Access**: Dynamic SQL uses dedicated read-only database user
- **Row-Level Security**: Database-level access controls
- **Query Timeouts**: Prevent long-running queries from blocking system

### Content Safety
```python
def _is_sql_safe(self, sql: str) -> bool:
    """Multi-layer SQL safety validation"""
    dangerous_patterns = [
        r'\b(DROP|DELETE|UPDATE|INSERT|ALTER|CREATE)\b',
        r'--', r'/\*', r'\*/', r';',
        r'\b(pg_|information_schema|sys)\b'
    ]
    
    for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, sql, re.IGNORECASE):
            return False
    return True
```

## 📊 Database Integration Strategy

### Connection Architecture
- **Primary Connection**: Application database operations
- **Read-Only Pool**: Dedicated for AI-generated queries
- **Connection Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion

### Query Execution Framework
```python
async def execute_raw_sql(self, sql: str, template_name: str, question: str):
    """Unified SQL execution with routing logic"""
    
    if template_name in PREDEFINED_TEMPLATES:
        # Fast path: Use optimized template execution
        return await self._execute_template(template_name, params)
    
    elif template_name == "dynamic_sql":
        # Flexible path: Parse and execute dynamic SQL
        return await self._execute_dynamic_sql(sql, question)
    
    else:
        return []  # Fallback
```

### Dynamic SQL Processing
The system includes a comprehensive SQL parsing engine that:
- Extracts date filters from generated SQL
- Handles natural language date contexts ("this month", "last year")
- Applies category filters and aggregations
- Manages sorting and limiting of results

## 🔄 Agent Communication Pattern

### True Multi-Agent Communication
Instead of hardcoded pattern matching, agents engage in structured dialogue:

```python
# Main Agent → SQL Library Consultant
"Can you handle this question: 'top 5 expenses this month'?"

# SQL Library Consultant → Main Agent  
"I found a partial match with 'recent_expenses' template, but it doesn't handle 'top N' sorting. Confidence: 0.3. Recommend dynamic SQL."

# Main Agent → Dynamic SQL Writer
"Generate SQL for top 5 expenses this month, no suitable template found."

# Dynamic SQL Writer → Main Agent
"Generated safe SQL with date filtering and LIMIT clause."
```

### Decision Making Logic
Each agent maintains its own expertise and makes autonomous decisions:
- **No hardcoded keywords**: Agents understand context and semantics
- **Confidence scoring**: Quantified decision certainty
- **Escalation patterns**: Agents can request clarification or hand-off

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Template-First Strategy
- **Common queries** (80%) use optimized templates for sub-second response
- **Complex queries** (20%) use dynamic SQL with acceptable 2-4 second latency

### Caching Layers
- **Template results**: Cache frequent query results with TTL
- **SQL generation**: Cache generated SQL for similar questions  
- **Schema metadata**: Cache database structure information

### Database Optimization
- **Proper indexing**: Optimize for common query patterns
- **Query planning**: Use EXPLAIN to optimize generated SQL
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient resource utilization

## 🔧 Implementation Best Practices

### Agent Prompt Engineering
- **Clear role definition**: Each agent knows its specific responsibilities
- **Structured output**: JSON responses for reliable parsing
- **Context awareness**: Agents understand the broader system architecture

### Error Handling & Recovery
```python
async def _handle_sql_error(self, error: Exception, question: str):
    """Intelligent error recovery"""
    if "syntax error" in str(error):
        # Regenerate SQL with more constraints
        return await self._retry_with_simpler_sql(question)
    
    elif "timeout" in str(error):
        # Suggest query refinement
        return "This query is too complex. Could you be more specific?"
    
    else:
        # Graceful fallback
        return "I encountered an issue. Please try rephrasing your question."
```

### Testing & Validation
- **Unit tests**: Individual agent responses
- **Integration tests**: Full query flow end-to-end  
- **Golden dataset**: Curated question/answer pairs for regression testing
- **Performance benchmarks**: Response time and accuracy metrics

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Agent parallelization**: Multiple agents can process different queries simultaneously
- **Database read replicas**: Distribute query load across multiple database instances
- **Microservice architecture**: Each agent type can be deployed independently

### Monitoring & Observability
```python
# Comprehensive logging for each decision point
logger.info(f"SQL Library Consultation: question='{question}', template_found={has_template}, confidence={confidence}")
logger.info(f"Dynamic SQL Generated: {sql[:100]}...")
logger.info(f"Query executed: {len(results)} rows returned in {execution_time}ms")
```
